This website collates songs, slogans, art, and poetry made for and about protests and revolutions from South Asia and beyond. I will translate the material into English wherever I can, and welcome translations into other languages. Join me.

It is a personal (non-affiliated) attempt to collect many voices and expressions of peoples struggles and solidarities, and I welcome your suggestions to better this showcase. For educators, a source. For people, an inspiration.

I will always credit the source/ maker/ author to the best of my knowledge, and I will always do my best to honor the creators' intent, please feel free to correct me if I have made an error.
